<h3>Project Description</h3>

We are planning to create a website to facilitate the buying/selling of sneakers between users on our website. This website will support sellers being able to either list and sell their sneakers, or buyers being able to view listings and purchasing sneakers. We will store user logins, as well as sale listings and price history on our website, as well as user shipping/purchasing information, and sneaker information. With this data, users will be able to create accounts, view listings, and view the price history of different sneakers they want to purchase. Additional functionally may include recommending sneakers based on previous purchases/page views, and displaying price charts.
